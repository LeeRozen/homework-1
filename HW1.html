                        The pomegranate (Punica granatum) is a fruit-bearing deciduous shrub in the family Lythraceae, subfamily Punicoideae, that grows between 5 and 10 m (16 and 33 ft) tall.
                        The pomegranate is rich in symbolic and mythological associations in many cultures.
                        The pomegranate was thought to have originated from Afghanistan and Iran before being introduced and exported to other parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe.
                        It was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769.
                        hey are widely cultivated throughout West Asia and Caucasus region, South Asia, Central Asia, north and tropical Africa, the drier parts of Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin.
                        The fruit is typically in season in the Southern Hemisphere from March to May, and in the Northern Hemisphere from September to February.
                        As intact sarcotestas or as juice, pomegranates are used in baking, cooking, juice blends, meal garnishes, smoothies, and alcoholic beverages, such as cocktails and wine.

                        Pomegranates can have up to three times more antioxidants than green tea or red wine.
                        Antioxidants protect our cells from damage caused by free radicals and reduce inflammation.

                        Studies suggest that pomegranates can help protect your heart in many ways, such as lowering blood pressure as well as blood sugar levels.
                        Pomegranates have polyphenol compounds called punicalagins or ellagitannins.
                        These antioxidants help prevent your artery walls from thickening and lower the buildup of cholesterol and plaque.
                        Pomegranates are rich in antioxidantsand flavonoids, both of which help prevent free radicals from damaging your cells.
                        In some early studies, pomegranates show potential in helping prevent prostate, breast, lung, and colon cancers.
                        Additionally, preclinical studies on animals have shown that eating pomegranates may help inhibit the growth of lung, skin, colon, and prostate tumors.
                        More research is needed to better understand these effects on humans.

                        To open a pomegranate, first cut off both ends. You may see the membranes that divide the inside of the fruit. Cut into the skin from top to bottom along these ridges. 
                        Next, slice deep enough to cut through the skin and the white membrane without cutting the pomegranate seeds. Hold the pomegranate over a bowl of water and pry it apart with your fingers. 
                        Pull the seeds away from the membrane and skin, allowing them to fall into the bowl of water. The membrane will float to the top of the water, and the seeds will sink to the bottom.
                        Remove the membrane, and throw it away. Drain the water from the seeds.

                        Pomegranate juice can be sweet or sour, but most fruits are moderate in taste, with sour notes from the acidic ellagitannins contained in the juice.
                        Pomegranate juice has long been a popular drink in Europe and the Middle East, and is now widely distributed in the United States and Canada.
                        Grenadine syrup originally consisted of thickened and sweetened pomegranate juice, 
                        now is usually a sales name for a syrup based on various berries, citric acid, and food coloring, mainly used in cocktail mixing.
                        Before tomatoes (a New World fruit) arrived in the Middle East, pomegranate juice, molasses, and vinegar were widely used in many Iranian foods, and are still found in traditional recipes such as fesenjƒÅn, a thick sauce made from pomegranate juice and ground walnuts,
                        usually spooned over duck or other poultry and rice, and in "ash-e anar" (pomegranate soup).
